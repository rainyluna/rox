//! A plugin's stream as the decoder sees it (ADR 29's first amendment, ADR
//! 30). The plugin serves container bytes by offset, and [`PluginSource`]
//! reads them like a file, with a window of recent bytes so the probe's small
//! backward seeks never go back to the plugin. A seek outside the window is a
//! read at the new offset, and on a stream that can't seek it's an error.
//!
//! The engine never knows what's behind an [`Opener`]. It's passed in with
//! the queue, so this crate never depends on the plugin host.
//!
//! A failed read isn't the end of the track. A seekable stream of known
//! length reopens through the opener with radio's backoff and carries on at
//! the byte it failed on, provided the reopened stream is the same length:
//! a different length is a different encode, and two encodes never splice.
//! A live stream gets radio's feed thread and tape instead, and rejoins at
//! the live edge with a gap. Only when that runs out does the track end with
//! a refusal naming the plugin.
//!
//! [`ReadAt::read_at`] blocks the decode thread (or a live stream's feed
//! thread) for as long as the plugin takes, and it's never called from the
//! output callback. Read-ahead and timeouts belong to the host side of the
//! opener.
