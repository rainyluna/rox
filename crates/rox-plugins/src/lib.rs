//! The plugin host (ADR 30): a plugin is a folder with a `plugin.json`, run
//! as a subprocess speaking JSON-RPC over its stdin and stdout. This crate
//! loads the manifest, hashes the folder, spawns and supervises the process,
//! and reads its streams. It knows nothing of the library, the player or the
//! UI; `rox-services` turns a host into an opener and a sync.
//!
//! A plugin runs with the user's permissions. What the host guarantees is
//! narrower: it only runs what the user switched on, it never trusts a byte
//! the plugin sends, and nothing it starts outlives it.
